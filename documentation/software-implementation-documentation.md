# software implementation documentation

## app general structure

The app has a command line user interface, from which some operation can be chosen: compression, decompression, and algorithm comparison.

The algorithm to build a Huffman tree is the one that uses two queues and list of symbols sorted by weight. The tree is converted to a canonical tree, so that it can be stored more compactly in the compressed file.

## accomplished time and space complexities (including big-O analysis of pseudocode)

## performance and big-O analysis comparison (if more than one algorithm was implemented)

## shortcomings and room for improvement
