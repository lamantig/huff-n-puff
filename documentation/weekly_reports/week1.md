# week 1

[weekly timesheet](https://github.com/nigoshh/huff-n-puff/blob/master/documentation/timesheet.md#week-1)

## what have I done?

This week I researched possible project subjects, which included cryptography (Signal protocol, Blockchain), AI (AI for the game of go), and data compression (Huffman code and possibly LZW algorithm). In the end I realized that the last idea was the best fit for this course, in terms of complexity, time required, and relevance.

## how has the app improved?

I've created the GitHub repository, initialized the Gradle project, added the repo to Travis, Codecov and Codacy. I've also written the software requirements specification.

## what did I learn?

I've learned some things about compression algorithms but I still have to do some research. I've learned much also about the topics that I didn't choose in the end, and I've thought about learning more about them in the future (attend some related course or research them on my own).

## what was unclear/difficult?

The most difficult thing was coming up with concrete project ideas for some of the subject areas I was interested into (namely cryptography and AI). In the end I couldn't come up with anything defined well enough to become this course's project.

## what will I do next?

In the coming week I will further research the Huffman code, and I will start to implement it. If there's time, I'll start also another compression algorithm's implementation.
