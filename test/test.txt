My Workouts: Brad Mehldau, independence, deep learning
ピアノ、即興、自由、独立と深層学習

The core of this thesis is a collection of workouts (exercises) I’ve developed during many years of studying improvisation at the piano.
Pianist Brad Mehldau has been a constant source of inspiration. In particular his revolutionary use of the left hand and his mastery of voice leading, polyphony, polyrhythms, polymeters and odd meters have radically influenced my studies, and therefore this work which tries to summarize them.
The concept of independence is an underlying theme, the main focus being hands’ independence and rhythmic independence. Independence means also freedom from rules and conventions, therefore innovation.
Deep learning algorithms and the concept of flow provide an interpretation key; they underline the vital role intuition and enjoyment play in learning complex matters like improvisation, and in the improvising process itself.
